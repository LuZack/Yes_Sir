# Yes_Sir
Terminal User Interface with ASCII arts

## Development

run
`mvn package` to compile

`python setup.py` to set the path for command

Then, use

`hey` anywhere on your shell to run the program.


## Inspiration

I am trying to make terminal version of Jarvis from Iron man

The main process generates thread for each task.
Each tasks work similar to Android kernel's layer

So, either it should limit the number of layers or make sure new layer will end at some point of program running.

## Extension Objectives

1. add, delete, edit schedules and visualize them. + alarm and emailing service if it runs on a server.
2. sync with local
3. enabling shell commands on the program so that it is not just a program but works as a extension of shell.
